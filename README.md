# Advanced Word Searcher

This is a work in progress.

This project is very useful for my personal reasons, as searching words can help in various purposes such as:
Word games such as Wordle and Scrabble.
Finding nicknames for one to use. 

However searching for words can be complex, as the English language has complicated rules.
Searching for words in word games games do not need consideration of the complicated rules, however finding nicknames will.
Navigate websites to find the words has many limitations, as websites only contain their own dictionary of words and do not have much advanced tools.
For example, they do not have words like biological taxa, foreign words, and names of certain chemicals.
For now I will use regular expressions to find words. 

For example, if someone's name is "Vincent", we can find a word that ends with "nt" and before the "nt" we allow a vowel and before that a "c" like sound.
We allow that "c" to be replaced by "ch", "sc", "cl", and "s".
This can help find a name like "Magnificent Vincent"

This is a work in progress.
